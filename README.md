# Exercise Instructions 

This exercise is created to help you diagnose and fix common Quarto errors students have in STA199. Please complete this exercise by doing the following:

1.  Render the document
2.  Analyze the error. Practice finding key words or phrases within the error message to help you find the error in the qmd file.
3.  Fix the error
4.  Think critically on how you would explain this error to a student

Repeat steps 1 through 4 until all errors are fixed and the document

**Note** The purpose is not to solve multiple errors at once. The purpose is to practice identifying the error message with the error, and critically thinking how you could TEACH this fix to your students.
